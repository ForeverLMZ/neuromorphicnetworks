# Learning function from structure in neuromorphic-networks


## "What's in this repository?"

This repository contains code and results for the manuscript "[Learning function from structure in neuromorphic networks](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.10.350876v1)" by Laura Suarez, Blake Richards, Guillaume Lajoie & Bratislav Misic.

We investigated the link between macroscale connectivity, and the computational properties that emerge from network dynamics in the human connectome.
We've tried to document the various aspects of this repository with a whole bunch of README files, so feel free to jump around and check things out.

## "How to run the things?"

First, you'll need to make sure you have installed the appropriate software packages, and have downloaded the appropriate data files. 

1. Clone the [neuromorphic-networks] (https://github.com/estefanysuarez/neuromorphic-networks) repository.
2. Download the "data" folder from [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4311814.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4311814), and place this folder into the repository's root directory!"

Once you've done that, you can get going with the following:

```bash
cd neuromorphic-networks
conda env create reservoir_computing 
conda activate reservoir_computing

```


## "I have some questions..."

[Open an issue](https://github.com/estefanysuarez/neuromorphic-networks/issues) on this repository and someone will try and get back to you as soon as possible!
